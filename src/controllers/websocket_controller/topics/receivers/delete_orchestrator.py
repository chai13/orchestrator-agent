    Handle the 'delete_orchestrator' topic to delete the orchestrator.

    This command performs a complete uninstall of the orchestrator-agent and all
    managed resources:
    1. Deletes all managed runtime containers (vPLCs) and their networks
    2. Deletes the autonomy-netmon sidecar container
    3. Deletes the orchestrator-shared volume
    4. Deletes the orchestrator-agent container itself (last)

    The response is returned IMMEDIATELY after validation passes. The actual
    cleanup runs in a background task. Use get_device_status with
    device_id="__orchestrator__" to poll for progress.

    Returns:
        On accepted: {"correlation_id": ..., "status": "accepted", "poll_device_id": "__orchestrator__"}
        On already in progress: {"correlation_id": ..., "status": "error", "error": "..."}
